# softsynthJS
javascript software synthesizer project

A analog type synthesizer triggered by programming a 'baby 8' style sequencer.
It has 8 steps with just note I/O, note pitch and volume controls.
Multiple oscillator with I/O, frequency, waveform select and volume controls,
it has a visual display displaying values and an oscilloscope.
ADSR generator, filter and LFO to emulate substractive synthesis.
Effects to mix with the master channel.
Master level gain control.

I will use Tone.JS for my audio engine.
The basis for the HTML content is Skeleton Boilerplate (http://getskeleton.com/)
 so the app could also be used on smaller screens.
My monosynthJS project was the first go on this and I want to redesign it
and improve it.


This is just a hobby project, because I like coding and I love synthesizers.
